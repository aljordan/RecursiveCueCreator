     <h2>Recursive Cue Creator Help</h2>
    

    <div>
    <p>Recursive Cue Creator is a Java application that 
    I wrote to generate cue sheets for use with the Cics Play memory player software 
    (or any other music player that supports cue sheets). The application will start at any directory
    you specify, and recursively drill through the directory structure, creating a separate cue sheet
    for each directory that contains wav or flac files.  In the <b>Options</b> menu, you can specify 
    whether to save all generated cue sheets to a single directory, or save each cue sheet within the 
    directory where the music files are found.  If you save all cue sheets to a separate output directory,
    all cue sheet entries will contain the full path to the music files.  If you choose to save to the
    folders where the music files are stored, the entries to individual music files are relative and
    do not include a full path.</p>

    <p>In general, a person who rips their music collection to individual flac files would not need 
    to use cue sheets because most media players will search your library and read the tags from 
    the mp3 and flac files.  Cics Play, however, does not include this functionality, and is 
    most conveniently used with cue sheets.</p>
    
    <p>This application is only useful if you have ripped your CDs to individual music files 
    per song, and if you have a directory structure something like <br>
    <b>Library Root\Artist 1\Album 1</b><br>
    <b>Library Root\Artist 1\Album 2</b><br>
    <b>Library Root\Artist 2\Album 1...</b><br>
	or<br>
    <b>Library Root\Genre\Artist 1\Album 1</b><br>
    <b>Library Root\Genre\Artist 1\Album 2</b><br>
    <b>Library Root\Genre\Artist 2\Album 1...</b><br>
    </p>
    
    <p>The program currently supports WAV, FLAC, MP3, and APE file types.  You can choose to
    read embedded tags in FLAC and MP3 files where available instead of having the application attempt to
    discern the tags from the file system directory structure.</p>
    
    <p><b>Directions</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Press the "Set Library Root" button and browse to the root directory of your music library.</li>
        <li>By default, the application will save a single cue sheet within each directory where music files are
        found.  The danger here is that there is a possibility that you could overwrite an existing cue sheet.
        To change this behavior, click on the "Use Custom Output Directory" check box, and browse to the 
        folder where you wish to save all of the generated cue sheets.</li>
        <li>Set options accordingly in the <b>Options</b> menu (see below).</li>
        <li>Press the "Process Library" button.  The application will show status and notify you when it is complete.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><b>Options</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Use Custom Output Directory</b>:  By default, the application will 
        write one cue sheet in every directory under the library root that it finds
        music files in.  This option will allow you to specify a single directory 
        to write all resulting cue sheets to.  When this option is set, all cue 
        sheets entries will contain the full path to each music file referenced
        in the cue sheet.  Clicking on this option will bring up a Directory Browser
        selection window with which you should choose the output directory where the
        cue sheets will be written to.  Selecting the <b>Cancel</b> button in the
        directory browser window will unset the option and restore the default
        functionality of the application.</li>
        <li><b>Use Embedded Tags when Processing FLAC and MP3</b>: By default, 
        the application will determine the cue sheet information from the music 
        library directory structure and file names.  Check this option if you
        would like the application to attempt to use information from the tags
        embedded in FLAC and MP3 files instead of folder and file names. This 
        option will increase processing time quite a bit because some flac files
        contain album art as well. If there is an error reading from the
        embedded tags for a specific music file, or if the tag is not available,
        the application will revert to using folder and file names to get information
        for that music file.  Note that the application does not read embedded tags
        from APE nor WAV files.</li>
        <li><b>Title Tracks "Artist - Title" when Track Artist Differs</b>:
        When reading embedded tags from FLAC and MP3 files, this option will
        set the track title to <b>Artist - Title</b> only when the track artist
        differs from the album artist.
        </li>
         <li><b>Substitute Composer for Genre when Genre is Classical</b>: This option
         will write the Composer tag into the Genre field of the cue sheet when Composer
         is available and the Genre is already set to "Classical".  This option is only
         useful when reading embedded tags from FLAC and MP3 files.  Setting it will
         have no effect otherwise.</li>
         <li><b>Remove Track Number and File Extension from Track Title</b>:
         This option will attempt to remove the trailing file extension and
         leading track number from the <b>Track Title</b> field.  When this
         option is used in conjunction with the <b>Use Embedded Tags when Processing
         FLAC and MP3</b> option, only files that do not contain embedded tags
         will be affected.
         </li>
         <li><b>Parse Artist and Album from a Single Parent Folder</b>:
         Use this option if you set up your music library using <b>single folders</b>
         named similar to <b>Artist Name - Album Name</b>.  When setting this option,
         a dialog box will appear asking you to enter the characters that separate
         artist from album title.  When you answer, make sure you enter blank spaces
         as well as other seperator characters.  For example, lets say one of your
         folders containing songs was named <b>Pat Metheny Group - The First Circle</b>,
         you would enter " - " (space dash space without the quotes).  The application will
         attempt to set the Artist and Album Title fields from the single folder name.
         </li>
         <li><b>Use One Parent Folder in Cue Sheet Name</b>: This option sets
         the name of the cue sheet to the name of the folder where music files
         are found.  When reading embedded tags in FLAC and MP3 files, the cue
         sheet is named from the Album tag.
         </li>
         <li><b>Use Two Parent Folders in Cue Sheet Name</b>: This option sets
         the name of the cue sheet to the name of the folder where music files
         are found, prepended by that folder's parent folder.  This option is 
         meant to be used when your library folder structure is <b>Artist \ 
         Album \ Songs</b>.When reading embedded tags from FLAC and MP3 files, 
         the cue sheet is named from the Artist tag plus the Album tag.
         </li>
         <li><b>Use Three Parent Folders in Cue Sheet Name</b>: If your library 
         folder structure looks like <b>Library Root \ Genre \ Artist \ Album \
         Songs</b>, the cue sheet names will be <b>Genre - Artist - Album.cue</b>,
         hence alphabetized by genre - artist - album instead of artist - album.
         When reading embedded tags from embedded FLAC and MP3 files, the cue
         sheets are named from the tags instead of the file system folders.</li>
   </ul>
    
    <p><b>Notes</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The application will work across mapped network drives, but will run slower.</li>
	<li>When using a custom output directory, the file entries in the resulting cue 
        sheets contain the full path to the file, so in this circumstance the cue sheets are 
        generally not transportable across computers.</li>
    </ul>
